### Overview

This api is used to update an existing item in ApiBrew.

First, you need to define a Resource in ApiBrew. Then you can update an existing item in that resource using this api.

### Specification

```curl
curl -X 'PUT' \
  'http://localhost:9009/{item}/{id}' \
  -H 'accept: application/json
  -H 'Authorization Bearer <token>' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{<payload>}'
  
Response: 
{
  "id": <id>,
  "type": <resource-type>,
  ...otherProperties
}
```

- **payload**: The payload to create the item. Example: `{"name": "John", "age": 25}`.

### Example

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 25
}
```

This will update the item with id `id` with name John and age 25.

Update is working in partial update mode. It means that, only given properties will be updated and other properties will
be kept as is.

```json
{
  "name": "John"
}
```

This will update the item with id `id` with name John and keep the other properties as is.

```json
{
  "age": null
}
```

This will update the item with id `id` and remove the age property.
