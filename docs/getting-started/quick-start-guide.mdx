Api Brew is a platform which allows you to create, manage and deploy APIs. It is designed to be easy to use and
flexible. It is built on top of **Kubernetes** and **docker**. It is designed to be used by developers, architects and
business users.

## What you need

- **Api Brew** instance
- **apbr** (client tool)

**ApiBrew is not generating any code.** It is a platform which allows you to create, manage and deploy APIs. It is
designed
to be easy to use and flexible. It is built on top of **Kubernetes** and **docker**. It is designed to be used by
developers, architects and business users.

* **To setup apibrew instance, register on [studio](https://studio.apibrew.io/)**
* **To install apbr on your computer [see](/cli/#installation)**

## Creating a simple resource

#### Declare book.yml

Let's define our first resource. We will create a **book** resource.  
We will define it in a file called **book.yml**

```yaml
type: resource
name: Book
title: Book
description: A book
properties:
  title:
    type: STRING
    unique: true
    required: true
  description:
    type: STRING
  author:
    type: REFERENCE
    reference: Author
```

#### Apply book.yml

Now we can apply this file to our **api-brew instance**

```bash
apbr apply -f book.yml
```

#### You can also use swagger to operate with your resources:

Navigate to Swagger docs url  
**https://(project-name).apibrew.io:8443/docs/swagger/index.html**  
you need to replace (project-name) with your project name
