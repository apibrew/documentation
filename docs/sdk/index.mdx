# SDK
## Overview

**SDK** is a set of libraries for working with Api Brew.  
It is different from nano in following ways:

- **SDK** - your code is hosed in your repository. Mostly it is in client side (browser, mobile app, etc.). But it can be in server side as well.  
**Nano** - your code is hosted in Api Brew. It is inside nano engine. There are no client side code. (you can still use resources in client side, but you cannot write nano code in UI)
- **SDK** - it has full functionality of Api Brew.  
**Nano** - is has limited functionality.

---

## Supported languages

Currently **SDK** supports **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **Java**, **Python**, **Golang**.

You can also interact with API Brew through **REST API** or **GRPC API**. It means that, even if sdk not available to some language, you can still use it.

---

## Setup SDK

You need to get **SDK** for your language from its package manager.

            <artifactId>client</artifactId>

        ```bash
        go get github.com/apibrew/sdk@latest
        ```
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Setup Client

Client is the main and lowest level library of **SDK**.  
It is responsible for communication with Api Brew.  
For any sdk functionality to work, the first thing you need is to setup client.

### Setup

There are various ways to setup client.  
Client is reading ~/.apbr/config.yml file for configuration. (which is also used by apbr)

<MultiCode {...setupClientFiles} />

### Resource operations

Once you have client, you can perform resource operations. (create, update, delete, etc.)

<MultiCode {...resourceOperationsFiles} />

---

## Repository

Repository is a higher level library. It is responsible for managing records.  
It is available in JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Python, Golang.  
For being able to use resource, you need to generate model first. (see [https://apibrew.io/docs/cli#command-generate](https://apibrew.io/docs/cli#command-generate))  
If you don't want to generate model, you can still use GenericRecord model.

### Setup repository

<MultiCode {...setupRepositoryFiles}/>

**Note:**  
If you use GenericRecord, you can use **getProperty** and **setProperty** methods to get/set properties dynamically.  
**getProperty** and **setProperty** is also available in generated models.

### Repository operations

**Repository** has following methods:

- **create** - create new record.
- **update** - update existing record.
- **delete** - delete existing record.
- **get** - get existing record by id.
- **apply** - create or update record.**Note!**For Apply, record must have a unique field(s). And this field(s) must be provided in payload. It means that, record payload must be uniquely identifiable.
- **list** - search records by query.
- **load** - reload record from apibrew.
- **watch** - watch record changes.

Let's see examples:

<MultiCode {...repositoryOperationsFiles}/>

---

## Extensions & Handlers

With help of extensions and handlers you can Api Brew resources functionality.  
They are like hooks, which are executed before/after resource operations.

For detailed information about extensions and handlers, see [https://apibrew.io/docs/fundamentals#extensions](https://apibrew.io/docs/fundamentals#extensions)

### Setup extension service

We have 2 extension service implementations:

- **Hosted**  
In this mode, Api Brew connects to your extension service. And it is sending events for execution.
- **Poller**  
In this mode, your extension service connects to Api Brew. And it is pulling events for execution.

Let's see examples:

<MultiCode {...extensionsFiles}/>

### Handlers

With help of handlers you can handle events, operate on them.  
For example, you can handle event beforeCreate on Book and do modification on item which is being created.

Handler interface has following methods:

- **when**  
It is control to indicate when handler should be executed.
- **operate**  
Here, you can specify how to operate on event.

Let's see examples:

<MultiCode {...handlerFiles}/>

#### When

List of available handler conditions:

- **and** - to combine multiple conditions with AND operator.  
`Condition.and(condition1, condition2, ...)`
- **or** - to combine multiple conditions with OR operator.  
`Condition.or(condition1, condition2, ...)`
- **not** - to negate condition.  
`Condition.not(condition)`
- **before** - to set the order of the extension to 10, indicating it should run before other extensions.  
`Condition.before()`
- **after** - to set the order of the extension to 110, indicating it should run after other extensions.  
`Condition.after()`
- **on** - to match a specific custom action.  
`Condition.on(customActionName)`
- **create** - matches the CREATE action.  
`Condition.create()`
- **update** - matches the UPDATE action.  
`Condition.update()`
- **delete** - matches the DELETE action.  
`Condition.delete()`
- **get** - matches the GET action.  
`Condition.get()`
- **list** - matches the LIST action.  
`Condition.list()`
- **async** - to set the extension as asynchronous.  
`Condition.async()`
- **entityExists** - checks if the entity exists.  
`Condition.entityExists()`
- **user** - matches specific users from the event annotations.  
`Condition.user(expectedUsers)`
- **resource** - to specify namespace and resources for the condition.  
`Condition.resource(namespace, ...resources)`
- **resourceFromEntityInfo** - to set resource and namespace from entity info.  
`Condition.resourceFromEntityInfo(entityInfo)`
- **group** - matches specific groups from the event annotations.  
`Condition.group(...expectedGroups)`

You can group this conditions to create complex conditions.

#### Operators

- **execute** - execute operator. It is for just executing some code when handler matches condition(s).  
`handler.when(Condition.beforeCreate())
       .operate(Operator.execute((event, entity) -> {})`
If you return entity from execute, it will be used as updated entity and it will be sent to Api Brew.
- **reject** - reject operator. It is for rejecting event when handler matches condition(s).  
`handler.when(Condition.beforeCreate())
       .operate(Operator.reject('Denied!')`
- **check** - check operator. It is for checking event when handler matches, if not matches, it will reject event. condition(s).  
`handler.when(Condition.beforeCreate())
       .check(predicate, 'Denied!')`
