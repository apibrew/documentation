# Authentication

## Overview

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user.

We recommend to use [Authorization](https://apibrew.io/docs/fundamentals/authorization) to protect your API

You can use this endpoint for both as access token and refresh token.  
You can consider access token as a short lived token and refresh token as a long lived token.

**term** - term of the token. Possible values:

- **VERY\_SHORT** - 1 minute
- **SHORT** - 20 minutes
- **MIDDLE** - 2 days
- **LONG** - 60 days
- **VERY\_LONG** - 2 years

## Authentication operations

<SwaggerApi
    spec={MetaJson}
    withoutModels={true}
    override={spec => {
        return {
            ...spec,
            tags: undefined
        }
    }}
    filterOperations={(operation) => {
        return operation.operationId === 'getAuthenticationToken' || operation.operationId === 'refreshAuthenticationToken';
    }}
withoutHeader={true}/>

**NOTE:** You can use this endpoint for both as access token and refresh token.

#### Usage

After obtaining access token you can use it to access protected endpoints.
For this you need to add **Authorization** header with bearer prefix to your request.

**Example:**

```http
GET http://localhost:9009/books
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```
