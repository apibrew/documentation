# Record

## Overview

**Record API** is a generic API for working with records.  
For each resource, **Record API** is working dynamically with the resource.  
If you create a **book resource**, you will have **book api**. Which will behave exactly like book API if you create it by yourself in any language. So **Record API** is for this purpose, it has set of **generic features** to cover record operations for all resources.

## Record operations

<SwaggerApi
    spec={MetaJson}
    withoutModels={true}
    override={spec => {
        return {
            ...spec,
            tags: undefined
        }
    }}
    filterOperations={(operation) => {
        return operation.operationId === 'getRecord' || operation.operationId === 'createRecord' || operation.operationId === 'updateRecord' || operation.operationId === 'applyRecord' || operation.operationId === 'deleteRecord' || operation.operationId === 'searchRecord' || operation.operationId === 'actionRecord';
    }}
    withoutHeader={true}/>

**Note:** all API endpoints are working with **\{namespace}-\{resource}** path.
For default namespace resources, namespace parameter can be omitted.
For example: **books** resource can be accessed by both **/default-book** path and **/book** path.
For simplicity it is best to use **/book** path.

### Record model

For each resource, **Record API** is working dynamically with the resource. And its payload structure is shaped according to the resource model.

#### For example

Assume that we have create Book resource with following fields: \[name, description\]

```yaml
type: resource
name: Book
properties:
  name:
    type: STRING
    unique: true
    required: true
  description:
    type: STRING
```

<SwaggerApi
    spec={MetaJson}
    withoutModels={true}
    override={spec => {
        return {
            ...spec,
            tags: undefined
        }
    }}
    filterOperations={(operation) => {
        return operation.operationId && operation.operationId.endsWith('Book')
    }}
    withoutHeader={true}/>

### Query & Filtering

For filtering, **Record API** is using **JSON Schema** standard.
You can find more information about JSON Schema from [here](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/index.html).
